# CST-339 Spring Boot N-Layer Application

## Introduction

In this course, we are designing and building an enterprise-class N-Layer application using the Spring Boot framework. We have freedom in choosing the application domain, such as an ecommerce site, customer management system, blog site, etc.

The application follows specific technical and functional requirements:

- Implements user registration and login
- N-Layer architecture separating presentation, services, and data layers 
- Industry best practices for exception handling
- Spring MVC presentation layer with Thymeleaf templates
- Data validation on form fields
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap
- Business logic implemented as Spring Services
- Implements CRUD operations on core business entities
- Relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) with Spring Data JDBC 
- Spring Beans and dependency injection
- Secured app with Spring Security and form login  
- Secured REST APIs with basic auth

## Project Milestones

The project will be built iteratively over 8 milestones:

**Milestone 1:** Project proposal, draft sitemap and division of work  

**Milestone 2:** Spring MVC implementation of registration, login, main layout, responsive UI 
   
**Milestone 3:** Add product creation module with Spring Core 

**Milestone 4:** Refactor to integrate Spring Data JDBC
   
**Milestone 5:** Add product read, update and delete modules

**Milestone 6:** Add Spring Security for form login and page authorization

**Milestone 7:** Implement REST APIs for products 
 
**Milestone 8:** Complete documentation and presentations

## Getting Started
